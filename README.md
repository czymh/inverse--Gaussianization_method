# inverse-Gaussianization_method

This is the pipeline of inverse-Gaussianization method which can use a set of convergence simulations to generate infinite weak lensing mocks. The theory part is detailed in the arXiv: [2001.10765](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10765).

For quick use, you can refer to the [text_example.ipynb](file://./test_example.ipynb) file.
